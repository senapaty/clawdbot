Hi {{ .Subscriber.FirstName }},

Someone asked me recently, "Sumi, what's that one trip that completely changed how you see the world?"

I didn't hesitate. **Turkey**.

## Why Turkey Changes You

Picture this: You're standing in the Hagia Sophia, watching the morning light filter through ancient windows onto Byzantine mosaics that have witnessed 1,500 years of history. A few hours later, you're floating above Cappadocia's fairy chimneys in a hot air balloon as the sun rises over a landscape that looks like another planet. By evening, you're sipping çay with a local family who insists you try their homemade baklava.

That's Turkey. Layer upon layer of civilization, warmth, and wonder.

## Our May Journey

I'm taking a small group of Wanderers to Turkey this **May 15-25, 2026**. Ten days that weave through Istanbul's grand bazaars, the surreal valleys of Cappadocia, and the turquoise coast where the Mediterranean meets ancient ruins.

**Why go with us in May?**
- Perfect weather — warm but not sweltering
- The roses are in full bloom in Istanbul's gardens
- Before the summer crowds arrive
- That golden evening light for photography

This isn't a rushed tour. We'll have time to get lost in the Grand Bazaar, to wake up early for that balloon ride, to sit with locals and understand why Turkish hospitality is legendary.

**Only 8 spots remain.**

Our Bengaluru community walk last month reminded me why I started WOW Club. Twenty women, most strangers to each other, laughing like old friends by the end of the morning. That's the magic — not just the places, but the people you meet along the way.
