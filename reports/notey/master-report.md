- Small team (2-10 employees) [[5]](https://www.linkedin.com/company/notey-inc)

## Risks & Challenges

## Investment Analysis

### Investment Positives
✅ Experienced founder with unique credibility  
✅ Clear differentiation from established players  
✅ Strong early traction and unit economics  
✅ Multiple revenue streams (B2B + B2C)  
✅ Growing market (13% CAGR)  
✅ Patent protection  

### Investment Concerns
⚠️ Small market within education niche  
⚠️ Yousician could copy key features  
⚠️ Founder time split across multiple careers  
⚠️ Long B2B sales cycles  
⚠️ Limited runway with current funding  

### Key Questions for Due Diligence
1. **Current MRR/ARR?** (Exact numbers)
2. **How is CAC $10 achieved?** (Organic vs paid mix)
3. **B2B pilot to paid conversion rate?**
4. **Founder's time commitment breakdown?**
5. **IP ownership and patent status?**
6. **Team composition beyond Mak?**
7. **Burn rate and runway with new funding?**
8. **Customer concentration?** (Is growth from 1-2 big districts?)

### Comparable Outcomes
- **Yousician:** Raised significant VC, €53M revenue, likely $200M+ valuation
- **Simply Piano:** Acquired by JoyTunes (strong exit)
- **Guitar Hero:** $2B+ peak, then crashed

### Scenario Analysis

**Bull Case:**
- Notey captures 5-10% of guitar learning market
- B2B scales to 500+ schools
- Yousician doesn't respond aggressively
- AR features create new category
- Exit: $50M+ acquisition

**Base Case:**
- Notey grows to 100K users in 2 years
- B2B becomes 30% of revenue
- Reaches $1M ARR
- Competition remains moderate
- Exit: $10-20M acquisition

**Bear Case:**
- Yousician launches kid mode in 6 months
- School sales cycles prove too long
- Founder reduces involvement
- Runs out of runway
- Outcome: Acquihire or shut down

## Final Assessment

**Grade: B+ (Strong potential, execution risk)**

Notey has a compelling product-market fit thesis with a credible founder and early traction. The combination of real instrument learning + gamification + kid-native design is genuinely differentiated. The B2B angle through schools is smart and defensible.

However, the competitive landscape is daunting. Yousician's resources and market position mean they could copy successful features. The founder's multiple commitments create execution risk. The niche market size limits upside potential.

**Recommendation:** Interesting opportunity for strategic investor who understands both gaming and education. Due diligence on B2B pipeline, actual retention metrics, and founder time commitment is critical. Consider leading or participating in the $1.5M round if terms are reasonable and B2B traction is verified.
