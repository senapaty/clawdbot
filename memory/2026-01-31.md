## New Learnings & Work Completed Today

### 1. Notey Investment Research (COMPLETED)
**Status:** Deep dive research completed and committed to GitHub  
**Location:** `reports/notey/` (7 documents, 1,500+ lines)  
**Key Finding:** B+ opportunity - strong founder (Grammy nominee), 590% YoY growth, but Yousician competition risk  
**Funding:** Raising $1.5M ($250K remaining), CAC $10, LTV $60  
**Action Required:** AK to review master report before potential investment

### 2. Technical Limitations Discovered
**Image Analysis:** `openai/gpt-5-mini` model returning empty responses  
**Workaround:** Use OCR text or external image URLs instead  
**Impact:** Cannot auto-analyze screenshots - need manual description or text extraction  
**Note for Future:** When AK sends images, ask for OCR text or description

### 3. Brave Search API Limits
**Issue:** Rate limiting (429 errors) after ~20 queries  
**Plan:** Free tier = 1 request/sec, 2000 queries/month  
**Strategy:** Batch searches, use snippets vs full fetches, prioritize queries  
**Status:** ✅ Working but requires pacing

### 4. WhatsApp Integration (FULLY OPERATIONAL)
**Two-way messaging:** ✅ Confirmed working  
**AK's number:** +919663732095 (approved)
