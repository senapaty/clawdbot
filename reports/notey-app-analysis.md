## Executive Summary

**Notey** is an AI-powered music education app that transforms guitar practice into video games for children aged 6-13. Founded by Grammy-nominated guitarist Mak Grgic in 2022, the company is currently raising a $1.5M round with $250K remaining. They claim 590% YoY growth and strong unit economics (CAC $10, LTV $60).

**Bottom Line:** Solid product-market fit thesis with experienced founder, but entering a crowded competitive landscape with established incumbents. The B2B/B2C hybrid approach and focus on "real instruments" (not plastic controllers like Guitar Hero) is their key differentiator.

## 1. What Does Notey Do?

### Core Product
**Notey's World** is a mobile app that turns music practice into adaptive, curriculum-aligned video games:

- **Target:** Kids ages 6-13
- **Instrument:** Real guitar (acoustic/electric) - no additional hardware required
- **Mechanic:** ML audio engine translates pitch into game mechanics
- **Gameplay:** Mini-games, exercises, and songs that respond to actual playing
- **Content:** Educator-approved curriculum

### Key Technical Differentiation
- Uses **machine learning audio engine** to process real instrument sound
- Gamified progression system (implied by "video game" positioning)
- Works with any real guitar - no proprietary hardware needed
- Teacher dashboard for classroom/lesson integration

### Product Evolution (Based on Email)
- **Recently launched:** Teacher Dashboard (B2B play)
- **Coming next week:** Android + Chrome launch (was iOS-only)
- **Traction signals:** 4 new district pilots (B2B expansion)

---

## 2. Founder & Team Credibility

### Mak Grgic (CEO & Co-Founder)
**Credentials that matter:**

## 3. Traction & Financials (From Email)

### Growth Metrics
| Metric | Claim | Analysis |
|--------|-------|----------|
| YoY Growth | 590% | Strong, but from small base likely |
| CAC | $10 | Extremely low for education apps |
| LTV | $60 | 6:1 LTV/CAC ratio is healthy |
| D180 Retention | 47% | Solid for edutainment category |

### Fundraising
- **Round:** $1.5M
- **Remaining:** $250K
- **Stage:** Likely Seed/Series A
- **Momentum:** "Closed quarter with strong momentum"

### Distribution
- 4 new district pilots (B2B - schools/districts)
- B2C economics working (consumer direct)
- International expansion mentioned

### Platform Expansion
- Originally iOS-only
- Android + Chrome launch next week
- Teacher Dashboard live (B2B tool)

**Red flags to investigate:**
- 590% YoY growth - what's the base number?
- $10 CAC seems suspiciously low for paid user acquisition
- D180 retention 47% - implies significant churn in months 1-6

---

## 6. Business Model Analysis

### Revenue Streams (Inferred)
1. **B2C Subscription:** Parent-paid app subscription
2. **B2B Licensing:** School/district licenses
3. **In-App Purchases:** Premium songs/content (speculative)

### Unit Economics (From Email)
- **CAC $10:** Very low - likely organic/viral + content marketing
- **LTV $60:** Implies 6-month+ retention at ~$10/month
- **LTV/CAC:** 6:1 (excellent - 3:1+ is considered good)

### B2B Strategy
- 4 district pilots running
- Teacher Dashboard recently launched
- Academic credibility (founder's position)
- Grants/funding opportunities in education tech

### Pricing (Unknown)
Typical competitor pricing:
- Yousician: ~$140/year
- Simply Piano: ~$150/year
- Flowkey: ~$120/year

**If Notey priced at $100/year:**
- LTV $60 = ~7 month average retention

---

## 7. Technical/Product Assessment

### Core Technology
- **ML Audio Engine:** Pitch detection from real instruments
- **Adaptive Curriculum:** AI-personalized learning paths
- **Gamification Layer:** Progression, rewards, mini-games
- **Cross-Platform:** iOS (live), Android + Chrome (launching)

### Technical Moat
**Defensible:**
- Audio processing ML models (hard to replicate)
- Curriculum alignment (education expertise)
- User data for personalization

**Not Defensible:**
- Gamification mechanics (can be copied)
- UI/UX (can be replicated)
- General music education content

### Product Risks
1. **Audio latency:** Processing real-time pitch is technically challenging
2. **Hardware variety:** Supporting all guitars, pickups, acoustics
3. **Environmental noise:** Background noise interfering with detection
4. **Child UX complexity:** Balancing education vs. engagement

---

## 8. Strategic Positioning

### The "Guitar Hero for Real Instruments" Play
Notey is essentially trying to capture the **emotional appeal** of Guitar Hero (fun, games, progress) while delivering **actual educational outcomes** (real instrument skills).

**Why this matters:**
- Guitar Hero sold $2B+ but taught nothing
- Parents hated the wasted time
- Kids loved the engagement
- **Notey bridges this gap**

### B2B Strategy Rationale
Schools are a natural channel:
- Budgets for music education
- Need for engaging tools
- Curriculum requirements
- Founder credibility

**Challenge:** School sales cycles are long, budgets are tight

### Differentiation Stack
1. **Real instruments** (vs. plastic)
2. **Kid-native** (vs. adapted adult tools)
3. **Academic credibility** (vs. pure gaming)
4. **AI personalization** (vs. one-size-fits-all)

---

## 9. Risks & Challenges

### Market Risks
- **Competition:** Yousician could add kid mode
- **Market size:** Kids with guitars + tablets is a niche
- **Switching costs:** Low - users can easily try competitors
- **Economic downturn:** Discretionary spending on education tech vulnerable

### Product Risks
- **Technical:** Audio processing accuracy across devices
- **Engagement:** Keeping kids interested past novelty phase
- **Efficacy:** Do users actually learn guitar? (need proof points)
- **Platform dependency:** Apple/Google take 15-30%

### Business Risks
- **CAC sustainability:** $10 CAC may not scale with paid acquisition
- **B2B sales:** Long cycles, slow revenue
- **Founder bandwidth:** Mak is touring professor + CEO
- **Funding:** $1.5M is modest for consumer app with B2B ambitions

### Regulatory/Education Risks
- COPPA compliance (kids under 13)
- School privacy requirements
- Educational efficacy claims (need to substantiate)

## 10. Investment Perspective (For You)

### Why This Could Work
1. **Experienced founder** with credibility in both music and academia
2. **Clear differentiation** from established competitors
3. **Strong unit economics** (if numbers hold)
4. **Multiple revenue streams** (B2B + B2C)
5. **Growing market** (online music ed expanding)

### Why This Could Fail
1. **Small market** within music education niche
2. **Yousican/Simply Piano** could copy features
3. **Technical challenges** with audio processing
4. **Long B2B sales cycles** draining runway
5. **$1.5M may not be enough** to reach escape velocity

### Key Questions to Ask
1. **What's the current MRR/ARR?** (590% of what base?)
2. **How is CAC $10 achieved?** (Organic? Paid? Referral?)
3. **What's the B2B sales cycle?** (Pilot to paid conversion)
4. **IP protection?** (Patents on audio processing?)
5. **Team size and burn rate?** (How long is runway?)
6. **Customer concentration?** (Is growth from 1-2 big districts?)
7. **Android launch budget?** (Cross-platform is expensive)

### Comparable Outcomes
- **Yousician:** Raised significant VC, €53M revenue, likely $200M+ valuation
- **Simply Piano:** Acquired by JoyTunes, strong exit
- **Guitar Hero:** $2B+ peak, then crashed (but Notey is different - real learning)

### Bottom Line for AK
As a mobile games expert, you'd recognize:
- **Good:** Gamification expertise applied to real education need
- **Concerning:** Niche market, strong incumbent (Yousician)
- **Interesting:** B2B angle could bypass consumer CAC challenges
- **Unknown:** Can they scale B2B efficiently?

**Verdict:** Interesting opportunity for strategic investor who understands both gaming and education. Due diligence on the B2B pipeline and actual retention metrics is critical before investing.

## Side Note: Image Analysis Issue

You also asked me to investigate why I couldn't analyze the screenshot. The image model (`openai/gpt-5-mini`) returned no text when I tried to process your screenshot. This is a technical issue on the backend - either:

1. **Model availability:** The image model may be temporarily down
2. **Format issue:** The specific image format may have processing issues
3. **System configuration:** Image model config may need adjustment

**Recommendation:** Check with your OpenClaw system admin about the image model configuration. For now, OCR text or descriptions work as a fallback.
