## 5. Monitoring Strategy

### 5.1 Frequency

| Category | Frequency | Trigger for Alert |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| US Visa Wait Times | Weekly | >30 day change |
| Schengen Appointments | 3x/week | Slots available |
| UK ETA | Weekly | Until Feb 25 deadline |
| ETIAS | Weekly | Launch date announced |
| Southeast Asia | Weekly | Policy changes |
| General News | Weekly | Major policy shifts |

### 5.2 Search Strategy

**Batch searches to minimize API calls:**

```
Batch 1 (Monday):
- "US visa appointment wait time India" freshness:pw count:3
- "Schengen VFS Global appointment India" freshness:pw count:3
- "UK ETA mandatory" freshness:pw count:3

Batch 2 (Wednesday):

Batch 3 (Friday):
- "Schengen visa fee 2026" freshness:pw count:3
- "Vietnam e-visa India" freshness:pw count:3
- "CGI Federal India issues" freshness:pw count:3
```

### 5.3 Cost Control Measures

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Brave Search free tier: 1 request/second
   - Space out searches by 2-3 seconds
   - 2000 queries/month limit

2. **Smart Fetching**
   - Only fetch full articles if headline is relevant
   - Skip paywalled content
   - Use snippets for initial filtering

3. **Deduplication**
   - Store all findings in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD-travel-news.md`
   - Check against past alerts before notifying
   - Don't report same news twice

4. **Batch Processing**
   - Run all searches in parallel where possible
   - Summarize once at end
   - Single commit to GitHub

5. **Selective Alerting**
   - Only alert on actionable changes
   - "Nice to know" vs "Must act now"
   - Respect quiet hours (11 PM - 8 AM IST)

### 5.4 Token Efficiency

**Estimated costs per monitoring run:**
- 9 web searches: ~900 tokens
- 3-4 article fetches: ~2,000 tokens
- Summarization: ~500 tokens
- **Total: ~3,400 tokens per run**

**Weekly cost (3 runs):** ~10,200 tokens  
**Monthly cost:** ~40,800 tokens

At Kimi Code rates (effectively free for this volume), this is sustainable.

**Optimization:**
- Use `thinking=off` for search aggregation
- Only enable reasoning for complex analysis
- Store raw results locally, summarize briefly
