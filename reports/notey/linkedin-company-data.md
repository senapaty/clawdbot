### Company Description
"90% of people who try to learn an instrument don't last more than a month. Notey's World is solving this issue by building a mobile music education game that users can play using any instrument lying around the house. This is done through utilization of an ML audio engine that translates pitch into game mechanics enabling gameplay through music practice. Currently there is an iOS and iPad app that has 3D worlds and educational overlays on a guitar mockup, to be continued with development into an AR experience highlighting where to play and how to play the guitar. This will also be extended into gameplay for other instruments as well, embedding free curricula to be used in-game by users' own contributions."
