I'm a Product Manager based in Bengaluru, India, with a passion for creating engaging digital experiences. My career has been focused on the gaming industry, where I've had the opportunity to work on features that have delighted millions of players and driven significant business outcomes.

## My Journey

My professional journey has taken me across gaming companies in London and India, where I've specialized in understanding what makes players tick and translating those insights into successful product features. I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of player psychology, game mechanics, and data analytics.

I hold an MBA from the Asian Institute of Management, where I focused on Technology & Innovation Strategy, Consumer Behaviour, and Strategic Negotiations. This foundation has been instrumental in my approach to product management, combining strategic thinking with user-centric design.

## What Drives Me

- **Player-Centric Design**: Understanding player behavior and creating experiences that resonate
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Using analytics and experimentation to optimize features and drive KPIs
- **Cross-Functional Leadership**: Bringing together diverse teams to ship impactful features
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying current with gaming trends, technology, and product best practices
- **Innovation**: Exploring new approaches to engagement, monetization, and player satisfaction

## Notable Work

One project I'm particularly proud of is my work on **Millionaire City**, where I developed entirely new features that significantly improved both engagement and monetization metrics. This experience reinforced my belief in the power of thoughtful feature design backed by solid data analysis.

I've also developed expertise in PvP game mechanics and competitive features, areas that require a nuanced understanding of player motivation, balance, and social dynamics.

## Beyond Work

When I'm not working on product features, I enjoy playing games (naturally!), following technology trends, and connecting with fellow product managers and gaming enthusiasts. I'm multilingual, speaking English, Hindi, and some German, which has helped me appreciate different cultural perspectives in product design.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing product management, gaming, technology, and innovation. Whether you're looking to collaborate, share ideas, or just have a conversation about building great products, I'd love to hear from you.
